Description
2017_11_12.  In order to resolve the circular import statements that
surfaced when I packaged the modules inside the agestrune subdirectory,
I've moved these defs from pgutilitiies.  In the older state, these required
that pgutilitites imports several of the pg modules, at least one of which
imports pgutilitities.  

This module's name pgparallelopmanager.py suggests it should manage
all of the ops (simulation, LDNe, and Viz), but for now only
has those defs which needed to be moved to solve  the import 
curcularity problem.  As such, pgutilities still has defs that
instantiate new processes for LDNe and Viz ops.

	this with this (bool-converted) value set to False, to avoid gui processing during

	2017_08_07.  Added def parameters s_output_mode and s_pop_het_filter_string, to
	allows caller to use new output mode selections and het pop filter in PGOpSimuPop instances.

	necessitated by fact that python2 (and 3?) was not able to pickle a
	class-instance def to be used to run replicates of the pgopsimupop doOp().
	Python also failed to pickle SWIG-based code used in Simupop.  Thus the
	better design, in which  multiprocessing Pools would stay  encapsulated
	inside a class object seem problematic, though may be implement-able using
	reg_copy -- but I'm not confident in state of regcopy of imported simuPop
	code, and so  I think is the safer solution, though it does create a
	depandancy of the pgguisimupop object on this outside def.  

	Note that this def runs a simupop operation using all the param values as
	given in the config file arg, except for the "reps" attribute, with is reset to 1,
	whatever the value in the configuration file.

	Tue Jul 26 22:01:07 MDT 2016 updated to be called by a driver that creates
	a new OS process, then calls this def to do the replicate.  No longer uses
	the dv_input_parm_values_by_attribute, but instead relies on reading a
	complete and up-to-date (i.e. all values as changed or edited on the gui
	interface) configuration files (that includes the "life table" params).

	2017_05_30. Added def param b_use_gui_messaging with default value True, to
	accomodate new module pgdrivesimulation.py which needs to call with False,
	to avoid gui messaging in a server setting.

	Note that the import works file in this context, when

	2017_06_11. Note we have added a new parameter, b_is_replicate_1,
	to tell the pgopsimupop instance that it is the first replicate.

	Failed to get independant initialization of population per-replicate
	when i used python's multiprocessing.process objects as hosts for 
	running replicates in parallel.  Solution as of now, 
	Sat Jul 30 22:38:42 MDT 2016, is to use OS processes via python's 
	subprocess module, creating them in this def, which gets its
	requisite info needed for the sim from the pgguisimupop instance
	that calls this def (this def is called by the GUI interface instance
	in a new python.multiprocessing.process instance, in order not to block the gui).

	Note that this def was originally inside the pgguisimupop instance that calls it,
	but on windows there was a pickling error not seen on linux or Mac.  Moving this
	target def for the python.multiprocessing.process outside the pgguisimupop instance
	seems to have solved the problem on windows (win 10).

	This def manages the replices via creating subprocesses, and 
	calling pgparallelopmanager.prep_and_call_do_pgopsimupop_replicate 
	(note: the call has been updated  2017_11_12, after the defs were
	moved from pgutilities into new module pgparallelopmanager.

	2017_05_30.  We added the def param b_use_gui_messaging=True, to allow
	this def to be called from a command line implentation (new module 
	pgdrivesimulation.py), and set the flag to false, without having to
	revise the call from the GUI pgguisimupop.py.
