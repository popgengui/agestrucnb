		Code added 2016_10_31, setting the tw member

		testing it before recreating it, seems to have
		resolved a bug, seemingly only associated with
		comboboxes and very rarely with text boxes,
		via my KeyVal objects, in which the tooltip
		window was created but never closed.  This
		was reliably invoked by using the keyboard
		to update a combobox, while the mouse was still
		over the control. On th ekeyboard selection, the
		tooltip windows would appear and persist, while
		new ones would appear over it.  This management
		and testing of the tw member seems to have solved
		it.
